> **_You should always step out of the comfort zone._**


I am a senior student at [School of Physics and Technology](http://physics.whu.edu.cn/en/Home.htm) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), where my major is Microelectronics Science and Engineering, expected to graduate in 2022. As a student member of IEEE, my research interest is Si-based RF/mm-wave circuit design, with a special focus on High-Sensitivity Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Resonator Sensors for Non-invasive Biomedical Detection. I have also mastered many simulation software and programming languages, including ADS, Cadence Virtuoso, multisim, C, python and so on. Previously, some Chinese Invention Patents and Chinese core journal publications are now pending or has been published, and also **a chip is under fabrication** in GF 130nm SiGe BiCMOS 8XP technology for multiple project wafer (MPW).

My current supvervisor is Prof. [_Jin He_](http://physics.whu.edu.cn/info/1053/2154.htm), [IEEE Senior Member](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37278606600), who received the Ph.D. degree from the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2011, and has been working on analog/RF/mm-Wave in both academia and industry during 2003-2013 in China and Singapore, respectively, holding positions of Engineer, Research Associate, Senior Research Engineer, Scientist, and Project Leader. He joined in Wuhan University, China in 2013 and is now an Associate Professor of the School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, China. His current research interests include analog/RF/mm-Wave/THz integrated circuit design in CMOS/BiCMOS/SiGe for optical and wireless applications.
